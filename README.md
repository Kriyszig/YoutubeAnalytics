# Youtube Analytics

This repository hosts the data and the analytics for the [Trending Youtube Video Statistics](https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/youtube-new) from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). This constitutes the project component for the course titled Introduction to Data Science [UE18CS203] at PES University.

The dataset is offered under the [Creative Commons License](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). For the time being, this repository is [unlicensed](http://unlicense.org)

### About the Dataset

The Dataset consists of the trending video statistics from the country of Great Britain - this was chosen to avoid having characters of other languages apart from English.  

As of now, the things that will be analyzed are:
* A brief overview of the nature of Dataset
* Analyzing the trending list based on words in Title
* Analysis of trending list based on the channel uploading the video
* Correlation of the trending videos and number of views
* Correlation of the trending videos and number of comments
* Correlation of the trending videos and the ratio of likes to dislike
* Role of categories in pushing videos to Trending
* The gradual change in the statistics over the time

The above bullet points will be replaced with a much more detailed description once the analysis part begins.
